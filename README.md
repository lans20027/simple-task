This is simple logic(?) task.
--just kidding version
Write a programm, which will insert "-" or "+", or even nothing between numbers from 1 to 9(strictly from smaller to bigger) so, that the result of this expression will always equals 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9 = 100. It is necessary that the programm finds all probable versions of this type of expression.
